# How Can I Contribute?
## Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug in the project, we encourage you to report it! Please make sure to check the list of open issues first to avoid duplicates. When reporting a bug, please include as much detail as possible.

- Describe the issue: Include a clear and concise description of what the bug is.
- Reproduction steps: Provide steps to reproduce the issue.
- Expected behavior: What should have happened instead?
- Environment: Include information about your environment (OS, eventual orchestration tools like Kubernetes, etc.).

## Suggesting Features
If you have an idea for a new feature, that's great! We encourage you to open a new issue to discuss the idea before you start working on it. This helps ensure that the feature aligns with the project's goals and that there is community interest.

- Feature discussion: Open an issue to describe your feature idea. Include a detailed explanation of the feature, its potential benefits, and any relevant use cases.
- Feedback: We'll review and discuss the feature request within the issue. This conversation will help determine if the feature is a good fit for the project and if it's something we'd consider merging.
- Contributing the feature: If the feature is accepted in principle, you're welcome to implement it and submit a pull request. Contributions are greatly appreciated, but please note that we may not have the capacity to work on all suggested features ourselves.

## Contributing the feature
Once your feature idea has been discussed and accepted in principle through the issue you opened, you are welcome to start working on it. Hereâ€™s what you should do:

Implementation: Fork the repository, create a branch from dev, and start implementing the feature. Make sure your code adheres to the project's coding standards and is thoroughly tested. If the feature you want to work on does already have a feature branch, work on that branch (and open the PR there).

Documentation: Update any relevant documentation to reflect the new feature.

Pull Request: Submit a pull request (PR) to merge your feature branch into the dev branch, or on the proper feature branch if there is one. In your PR, reference the original issue and provide a clear description of the changes.

Example:
If your issue number is #42, you can reference it in your PR description like this:

```markdown
This PR implements the feature discussed in issue #42. It adds [brief description of the feature].
```
Or, for automatic closing of the issue upon merging:

```markdown
This PR implements the feature discussed in issue #42. It adds [brief description of the feature].

Closes #42.
```

Review Process: The PR will undergo a review to ensure it meets the project's quality standards and aligns with the agreed-upon feature idea. If the implementation is consistent with the discussed feature and passes review, it will likely be merged.
