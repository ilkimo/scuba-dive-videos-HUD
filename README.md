# About
This project wants to enable scuba divers to easily add dive data as an Heads-Up Display overlay onto videos from the dive.

The only tricky part is the alignment between the dive data (CSV file) and the videos. Here we try to align with the datetime from the dive data and the videos metadata, so it would be necessary to align the date and time of the PC and cameras right before the dive.

# Project Progress
At this moment the project is not ready yet, work is ongoing.
